Kaggle in-msbd5001 competition 


I write this program mainly in Google Colaboratory, and the language used is Python.

Following packages needed：pandas, numpy, re, datetime, wwo-hist, urllib, matplotlib, sklearn, xgboost。

To get the submit file:1. Run traindata_clean.ipynb to generate the processed train and test data file.
2. Run model_train.ipynb steply to generate the final submit csv file.


And my resulting test.csv file is xgboost_submit_final.csv
